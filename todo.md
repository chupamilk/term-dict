- Sometimes, I am traslating some sentences but as you know, duden or wiki doesn't work with sentences, so make a function to take only the word. 
- Problem: User is not able to see what the program is able. The user maybe forgot how to only translate the word and not type it in the file. 
- Add a src folder.
- Change the location of the "words-texts" file.
- Add the dictionaries that shows Nomens with all their singular and plural form.
